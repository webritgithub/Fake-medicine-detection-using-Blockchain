# Fake-medicine-detection-using-Blockchain
### I developed a website that uses blockchain technology to detect fake medicines. This platform ensures every step of the drug supply chain is transparent and secure. By recording each transaction on the blockchain, it guarantees the authenticity of medicines, enabling real-time verification and traceability. This protects consumers and ensures trust in healthcare.
